# Axiom

Axiom is a free and open-source, cross-platform Digital Asset Management (DAM) app that helps you organize your art and design assets all in one program!

## Goals

I'm building Axiom with a few goals in mind:
- Learning to program desktop apps with Electron.
- Create a solution to a problem I have with software like Adobe Bridge.
- Leverage my design capabilities with HTML/CSS.
- More goals to come!
